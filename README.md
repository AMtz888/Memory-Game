# Udacity's Memory Game Project

## The Game
This is a classic memory game where you must flip two cards over at a time until
you find a match. There are 16 cards that are automatically shuffled and arranged
in a 4x4 square. If the two cards flipped face up are the same, they stay facing
up. If not, they are flipped face down again. The goal is to find all eight pairs.

The game keeps track of how many moves have been made, how much time it takes to
complete the game, and gives a star rating depending on the how many moves it
takes to find all the pairs.

* 3 Stars - 13 moves or less
* 2 Stars - 14 to 20 moves
* 1 Star - 21 moves or over

There is also a restart button should you wish to start over.
